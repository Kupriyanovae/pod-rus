This Camp is not just Galliards. The Theurges seek out and learn Rites, making sure that none are lost as the Apocalypse approaches, and the Philodox preserve the ancient wisdom of past Judgments.

After a long period of tutelage, they’re taken to meet the Fae, and hopefully to join the Tuatha de Fionn as full members.

The Bubasti were cursed long ago by the ancient vampire deity Set, and as a result, their lives are forever tied to the soils of Khem, their ancestral home. It is said that if all of the Bubasti of a given generation leave Egypt, that generation will be the last. None know the truth of this rumor, but none care to test it, either.\nDue to their war with Set, they are closely aligned with Horus' Osirian League and their six leaders, the Kheper, have achieved immortality." 
 
 ceilican: "Ceilican"
 ceilican_adj: "Ceilican"
 ceilican_adherent: "Ceilican"
 ceilican_adherent_plural: "Ceilicans"
 ceilican_desc: "Also called Ring Dancers, they originated in northern Europe, and have strong ties to the fae but are not fae themselves. The Ceilican can trace their ancestry back to the maneless lions of northern Europe and are regarded as cousins to the Simba (although every Simba would be outraged to be compared with one of the Ring Dancers). During the terrors of the War of Rage that destroyed their kin, the surviving Ceilican pledged themselves to a lord of Faerie, who soon enslaved them and infected them with their mercurial mannerism and even their weakness against cold iron."

 khan_desc: "The Khan, also known as the Bright Kings, are weretigers, and are one of the nine remaining tribes of the Bastet. They see themselves as the bulwarks against the darkness, who are Gaia's most perfect creations and as such obliged to protect all who are lesser. While usually independent and unsocial as any werecat, many Khan are allied to the Beast Courts.\nAn honorable folk, the Khan evoke the respect the lions demand."
 
 simba: "Simba"
 simba_adj: "Simba"
 simba_adherent: "Simba"
 simba_adherent_plural: "Simbas"
 simba_desc: "Simba are werelions. They are also known as Lords of Sunlights or Dark Kings. The Simba represent the best Gaia has to offer, in that they are regal, proud, and powerful beyond compare. However, they are also arrogant, domineering, and malicious, even under the best of circumstances.\nThey believe things are simply out of order. When the balance is restored, when the humans know their place, and when cities become graveyards, the lions will be proven right. In the minds of the Simba, the demons of the dark ages can be traced to the end of Impergium and the laxity of the Changing Breeds. And they intend to put things in the right order: if that requires bloodshed, so be it. Warfare is the sport of kings." 

 swara: "Swara"
 swara_adj: "Swara"
 swara_adherent: "Swara"
 swara_adherent_plural: "Swara"
 swara_desc: "The werecheetahs of the Bastet tribes are also called the Silver Folk. Like their kin, they are extremely fast and travel much. They also have a unique link with the [Concept('umbra', 'Умбра')|E]. Of all tribes of the Bastet, the Swara are the least understood. This is a result of their very isolated culture. Swara are the only breed of Bastet able to step sideways, allowing them to travel to realms within the [Concept('umbra', 'Умбра')|E] that their brethren are unable to reach. Some speculate that this is a result of their strong relationship to Luna, who most Swara revere. Some legends claim that it was a Swara who first visited the moon during the time of the Impergium, and it was this that taught them the meaning and importance of the war against the Wyrm and how dire the situation is." 

 ajaba_religion: "Ajaba"
 ajaba_religion_adj: "Ajaba"
 ajaba_religion_adherent: "Ajaba"
 ajaba_religion_adherent_plural: "Ajaba"
 ajaba_religion_desc: "Ajaba are werehyenas. The legends of the Ajaba say that they are the African counterparts of the Garou, created to be Gaia's warriors in a continent without wolves. However, in part due to the division of roles among their genders, the Ajaba have spent much of their history bickering amongst each other. The most notable trait of the Ajaba is that they are strongly divided along gender lines: female Ajaba are warriors, with generally high Rage and lower Gnosis; males are mystics, with opposite tendencies. Some small number of Ajaba are born with inverted traits for their gender, and are seen as omens of great good or ill."
