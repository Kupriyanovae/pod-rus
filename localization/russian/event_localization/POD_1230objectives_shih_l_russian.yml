 pod1230objectives_shih.1.t: "Rediscovering Wan Kung Yi Training Style"
 pod1230objectives_shih.1.desc: "Wan Kung Yi is traditionally held as the first Shih. This man of the Shang dynasty had a long and adventurous life, starting with clear hostility to the supernatural that ruled over the land before understanding that they too had a place in the cycle of the natural order.\nYi thus dedicated his long life to fight only those who truly threatened humanity and thus learned much from sympathetic supernatural beings in the process. These teachings became the basis of the Shih as a whole and made them the formidable force they still are today. Among other things, Yi codified the Qiao, giving access to these powers to his worthy students so that they could battle true evil on an even playing field."
 pod1230objectives_shih.1.a: "Master Yi was wise."

 pod1230objectives_shih.2.t: "Continuing Wan Kung Yi Legacy"
 pod1230objectives_shih.2.desc: "Wan Kung Yi wasn't a perfect man. The founder of the Shih, despite his conciliatory stance on the supernatural, flew into a great rage when his family was killed by some of them. Using his bow crafted from the Trees of Immortality, Yi purged viciously those that wronged him in a deluge of anger and blood. This earned him the nickname of the "Excellent Archer" among the supernaturals who still remember his rampage.\nThe Shih however know that Yi paid dearly for his outburst and beech of his own teachings. Each arrow he shot in anger costed him his very lifeforce and, once the purge was done, Yi's very soul was tainted. He wasn't long after that he left this world.\nWise Shih learn for this example and focus their training as much on the mental as they do on the physical."
 pod1230objectives_shih.2.a: "Anger is the enemy."

 pod1230objectives_shih.3.t: "The Just and Wise Cause"
 pod1230objectives_shih.3.desc: "After the founder of the Shih, Wan Kung Yi, died, the demon hunters soon reorganized themselves into a great Celestial Army dedicated to purging the supernatural. They grew arrogant, lording over the mortals and killing everyone who opposed them. Wiser Shih stuck to Yi's teachings and refused to bow to the Celestial Army.\nThis proved to be an auspicious course of action when, in an unprecedented move, the supernaturals allied to utterly destroy the Celestial Army and its headquarters in Kun Lun.\nThe Shih, now the last survivors of Yi's legacy of demon hunters, felt that the natural order has struck back against their wayward cousins and moved on.\nWith your power and followers growing however, some argue that the Celestial Army's cause was just and that only its methods and leadership were flawed. They push for you to take back this divisive mantle and make it yours."
 pod1230objectives_shih.3.a: "It was folly then, it is folly still."
 pod1230objectives_shih.3.b: "The Celestial Army is reborn!"
 pod1230objectives_shih.3.c: "I will stand on my own."
