Upon hearing how she has been used and had so many men die on her account, Finnabair drops dead of shame. 'Hence the name Finnabair Sléibe, Finnabair of the Mountain.'"

 POD_podlore.100.desc.POD_fae_character_250: "Two centuries past the son of Ragnelf and Sweyn Forkbeard decided to try his hand at ruling mortals. Known as Canute the Great, he ruled over the North Sea Empire of England, Denmark and Norway until 1034 AD. To rule over the recently (by Fae reckoning) conversion of the population to the Christian Church, Knud learned the rituals and lore of the faith. He imitated the pious too well and end up joining the Constantinian cause, albeit with Winter's particular take as a Viking reaver king hell bent on conquest. The moment of his conversion is told in the story 'Canute and the Tide'. The king set his throne by the sea shore and commanded the incoming tide to halt and not wet hsi feet and robes. He attempted a powerful cantrip to this effect, and in sight of true belivers... his magic faltered. The tided continued to rise as usual and dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his royal person. Knud leapt backwards saying 'Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none worth of the name, bu He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws.'  He then hung his gold crown on a crucifix, and never wor it again 'to the honour of God the almighty King.' Tiring or reaving and mortal rule, he faked his death and returned to House Aesin to spread the Constantinian faith to his ancestral house."

 POD_persistentpodlore.desc.793278: "This character was created by PoD Developers to add greater depth to the setting and is not an official part of the [world_of_darkness|E].\n\nThroughout Mongol history, it was commonplace for many of their less than valued members to be sent into exile in neighboring empires. For many, this was a horrible thing, to be driven from their home. But for Batbaybar, he couldn't have been happier. From his youth Batbaybar held a great and profound appreciation of the arts. Starting in bowmaking and fletching, he would rather spend his time weaving tapestries and carving than hunting. So absorbed in his arts that when his community was attacked, one warrior had broken into his yurt to kill him, the battle lost but so immersed in his craft he hadn't even noticed. He did successfully escape, and fled to the southwest, towards the Iranian Plateau. There, he was enamored with their works, and eagerly plied his skill as an artisan. It was here he caught the eyes of the Banu Haqim, and was brought into their fold as a member of the Viziers.\n\nBatbaybar is the picture of the creative frenzy that grips the Viziers. But now his works have been disrupted. As the Mongols march deeper into Iran, he is terrified at the destruction some of their generals are bringing. And worse, the Anda ride in their shadow. Batbaybar hates their march, and wants to preserve those great works. So he has resolved to hold the line on behalf of the Clan, choosing to die before he lets the Anda destroy the works he has so long labored to protect."

Born among Dalit exiles from India traveling west, Aglaia was among the first of her people to see the walls of Constantinople. Immediately unwelcome and eagerly clapped in chains, Navneet was planning to flee with her people further into the European interior, had there not been a woman that greeted her in the night, and asked to discuss philosophy with her. Despite having spent her time on the road, Navneet wished for a homeland. She wished for a world where she and her family could breathe easy and breathe free, unshackled and unburdened. She spoke of places she hoped for, and lamented if only she had the power to do so, she would make that a reality. \nThe woman figured she would make a perfect Brujah as Navneet spoke of her perfect world. \n\nSince her Embrace, Navneet has moved a lot, seeking the place that she could try to build the hope of her people, now tempered and given clarity by the utopia of Carthage her sire told her about. However, since the rise of the Mongol Empire, she has seen opportunity. She sees potential there, a place where she can build a paradise deep in the Steppes, a syncretism of Carthage and her dreamed sanctuary for the people who would come to be called the Romani."

He would find his glory when the Loulan King Angui murdered several diplomats. Despite being a stable hand at the time, Fu was chosen for being sent out to stab the king to death, but he instead volunteered a different plan, and killed Angui by tricking him with gifts and getting him drunk, where his guards then immediately disposed of the King. Granted a title for his service, Fu was proud, and saw to his new office.\nBut something in him lingered. He missed study. He had found his glory, but something was still nagging at him. He wanted to learn more, he wanted to study, and he wanted to grow his knowledge.\nMuch to his surprise, he found a kindred spirit, who always came at night to speak to him on the nature of death under heavy robes. In the final years of mortal life, they were deep friends. And as he began to succumb to his age, the traveler had offered him a gift, to be able to have the life he left behind, in a new state. Fu accepted, and was Embraced into the Cappadocians.\n\nSince then, Fu has largely contended himself with his studies. However, the recent surge in death as the Mongols grow outward has resolved him to take greater actions. The Mongols remind him much of the Loulan of his own life, and with the great disturbances they are performing to the dead, he has resolved himself to action. He always wanted to be more than a bookworm after all. And what is one a second king, when one can already be killed so easily?"
 POD_persistentpodlore.desc.793281: "This character was created by PoD Developers to add greater depth to the setting and is not an official part of the [world_of_darkness|E].\n\nBorn on the march across the Urals, Temüülen was born sickly, ill, and measly. From his birth, his life on the steppes was a constant struggle. Always sick, openly disliked by his fellows, Temüülen's life was always marked by being on the fringes and openly ridiculed by the rest of his extended family. While his family were part of the raid teams for Europe, he was often too physically weak to properly use a bow, and as such was treated as worthless on such campaigns. \nHowever, in one incursion, they made the mistake of attacking the wrong church. In the night, it exploded in darkness, swallowing everyone within whole. Temüülen fled as hard as he can, and that night was the worst, and last, of his life. Despite the impossibility, he faced it like he always had. Struggling in the face of the impossible and refusing to roll over and die. And this impressed the attacker, who then took Temüülen into the Lasombra. \nHis 'education' merely reaffirmed Temüülen's will to survive, but also his hate. More than anything, Temüülen hated the system that always saw him as weak. And now he is strong. He is as a god to mortals, and he relishes the feelings of objective superiority he now has over them. He relishes the crown of darkness set upon his head, and wants nothing more to make it eternal, to show all who had thrown him aside he is strong."

Tapestries, musics, sculptures, paintings, instruments, architecture, and countless other forms of art both physical and emotional are commonplace. But Otgonbayar sees a far greater beauty in a well bred animal than just a painting.\nIn mortal life, Otgonbayar was her clan's main tender to their horses and livestock. Every pairing was her choice, and she found a great sense of satisfaction in seeing the herds and stocks of her clan improve within animal generations. And so great was her own purebred horse that, while on a trading journey to a city, a figure in the night was so enthralled by her work, that they couldn't let such an artist die before she could create her masterpiece.\nOverall, her embrace didn't change Otgonbayar much, because now she has all the time in the world to perfect her sciences and arts. Her own herds are among the finest in the world, ever pairing controlled for centuries to create the perfect progeny. However, as she gazes upon her pefect herds, she wants to move to the next step. She looks back to the humans that surround her, and wonders, possibly, if in this time of strife the same can be done to man..."

However, along the journey, their Tremere handler met final death, and Delta, alongside her clutch, led them to safety within the Urals, before flying further east.\nNow free from the Bloodbond and escaped with her sworn companions, Delta jealously guards their new freedom. The world of night in the steppes are chaos, and they are uniquely skilled at surviving in these regions both with their wings and ability to meld into the earth. But greater still, she fears the Tremere seeking out this lost clutch, no matter how much of a waste it would be to find them. So she jealously guards them their shared refuge, hunting together and never parting. And as the chaos of the Anda draws nearer, she is forced to make a choice.\nDo they continue to hide? Or do they try to build something lasting to protect themselves within?"
 POD_persistentpodlore.desc.793287: "This character was created by PoD Developers to add greater depth to the setting and is not an official part of the [world_of_darkness|E].\n\nOne of the more esoteric of the Ceoris Gargoyle, Omega was a particularly strange creation, and for reasons beyond her understanding, paired with Delta. Sent with their pack East, the death of their Tremere handler at Mongol intervention freed her, and having nowhere else to go, she stuck close to Delta, going with her deeper into the steppes.\nOmega is the heart of their pack, but above all is the most fanatically loyal of the group to Delta. Beyond just being Omega's protector in the Gargoyle pits, Delta has let Omega stay close. She is devoted, and in the absence of the Bloodbond Omega throws herself deeper into Delta's embrace for the deeper sense of clarity and protection she offers.\nBut Omega worries for her pack. As the Anda and other Cainites of the steppes move around them, Omega begs Delta to build a place where they can hide not as animals, but rule as their masters once did. She longs to see a crown on Delta's head, and is willing to do anything for her Pack Leader to do so. She only just wishes Delta would see it the same way."

Born the son of Shashigupta of the Paropamisadae, Jayendra saw his home come under threat, by a strangely successful and unhinged conqueror coming from the far west. But where his father occilated wildly in regards to Alexander, Jayendra always knew he could bring no good. Going against his father's wishes, he immediately led his men against the Greeks, engaging them where Alexander was not. For the most part, he was successful. However, when he began to make good headway, he was suddenly ambushed in the night by a horrible creature of madness, using horrific magics and mania itself to shatter his army. However, he refused to flee, and instead charged the creature through the infernal flames and deluge of madness. His strike failed to connect though, and he was struck down by them.\nJayendra would have died there, had he not impressed another figure watching him.\n\nThe man who embraced Jayendra immediately put his skills to work. Serving both as a diplomat and general, Jayendra fought regularly and successfully in the Eternal War, but often, his own rankling under authority made it so he always quarreled with his sire. So, when word reached the Kshatriya of the Great Mongol Nation's expansion and the Anda's own ride, Chandraputra sent Jayendra as an envoy and military advisor.\nAs far as Jayendra was concerned, this was for the best, as he had wanted a change of pace from fighting the Hungry Dead. He hopes to learn many new strategies in his current position, where he eagerly awaits whatver directions the winds blow."
 POD_persistentpodlore.desc.793290: "This character was created by PoD Developers to add greater depth to the setting and is not an official part of the [world_of_darkness|E].\n\nBorn on the Tibetan Plateau to a small village, Tshering by all standards was destined for an unassuming and uneventful life, each day being the same as the last. However, even as a child, the rebellious streak that burned within her was clear, the very same flame that would one day change her forever.\nStarting with small things, like her mom's hair bands and the village's master's shoes, she kept scaling higher and higher, up until her greatest score, where, sneaking into a temple believed to be abandoned, she stole a jade talisman guarded by an old man who turned into a demon, fleeing as fast as her legs would carry her from the theft. As she disappeared into her home village, she breathed a sigh of relief. But she had really done it, as after that devils stormed the village, looking for her. So she used all of her skill as a thief to disappear back into the wilderness, but she was stopped by someone who had actually be stalking her score.\nThe fellow thief offered to train her, and make her greater than anything else she could have dreamed of. Tshering accepted wholeheartedly, and was became one of the Thieves of the Wu Zao Salubri.\n\nTshering is good at what she does, and she loves doing it. As a vampire she now seeks greater and greater scores, always outdoing her prior scores. Now, she sets her sights on Mongolia, as the one thing she has never stolen was a throne, and the Anda march across the world. Perhaps it is time for a new kind of heist, a much bolder score.\nWhat is more valuable than a throne, afterall?"
 POD_persistentpodlore.desc.793291: "This character was created by PoD Developers to add greater depth to the setting and is not an official part of the [world_of_darkness|E].\n\nBy all metrics, Jiang shold have been a footnote in history. Born during the decline and eventual collapse of the Han Dynasty, Jiang would see, and experience, firsthand what it was like to be in a falling empire. Her home village was extorted of all its food, and when her father and brothers turned to banditry to feed themselves, they were caught by the Warlords and put to death. When the village protested the slaying and purposely trying to focus on how they never raided their overlords, the Warlord had the entire village put to the torch. Very few survived, but among them was Jiang. The whole ordeal radicalized her deeply, as she resolved to destroy the warlords and empire that saw her family butchered and home destroyed.\n\nAlongside her sworn sister Zheng, they set out. However, they were a small force, only known for the novelty of women commanding bandits, and when they were defeated in battle by Cao Pi, they were promptly sentenced to death.\nBut there was someone watching over the both of them. After a particularly brutal ordeal with a prison guard, Jiang awoke to a scream, as a three eyed figure opened her cell. The creature, Zao-Xei, came upon her, and embraced her into the Wu Zao. However, Jiang was furious. Here this pretentious thief was lecturing her, had killed her, stood by as she was mutilated, and let all the evils of the world happen.\nAt the soonest opportunity, alongside Zheng who had been similarly turned, fled into the night. In their travels, they would meet another wanderer, espousing a path closer to their own, of a world without gods or masters. The three then swore and oath, that their new Blood Tribe would see their utopia come to pass. \nAnd come what it may, Jiang will strive for her revolution. No matter the cost."
 POD_persistentpodlore.desc.793292: "This character was created by PoD Developers to add greater depth to the setting and is not an official part of the [world_of_darkness|E].\n\nFrom chaos, change is made. From the tumult of her life, that is the lesson that Zheng internalized. Born in a small village in Northern China during the decline and collapse of the Han Dynasty, Zheng did her best to provide for her community as a hunter, while the local warlords squeezed it dry of all they could. However, such was not to be, as several other members of the village turned to banditry to survive, and in a horrible chain of events, one day as she was out hunting, she returned to several of her village fleeing into the mountains, as she crested a hill and saw it aflame. Horrified and furious, she resolved to pick up her bow and get justice, no matter the cost, for her destroyed home. So, she joined one of the other survivors, Jiang, in her own zealous campaign against the Han.\nHowever, despite Zheng's own familiarity with the region, they were a small mass of bandits against the growing power of Cao Pi. They never stood a chance, and captured, Zheng was condemned to death. Internally shattered, she awaited it going from her last few days with a robotic monotony. One night after a particularly brutal affair with one of the guards, a three eyed man broke into her cell, and much to Zheng's horror, they killed her and brought her back as a vampire.\nZheng was horrified beyond belief. She wanted to die, her home was gone, her cause destroyed, and now her very life stolen from her. And her killer had the audacity to call it a gift, and then punish her for her grief. So she ran with her friend from her mortal life, looking for something, anything to fill the void in her empty heart. It wasn't until she met a wandering foreigner from Japan, who strove for a society in the night with no lords, and no masters that she found a fire once more. One that she now desperately wants to keep burning."
 POD_persistentpodlore.desc.793293: "This character was created by PoD Developers to add greater depth to the setting and is not an official part of the [world_of_darkness|E].\n\nBorn as the daughter of a Laktan rider and a Russian captive, Sati was an unremarkable child destined for an unremarkable life. The tribe was haughty and sometimes harsh with her due to her lineage but she still was mostly pleased with her life, having seen far worse fates in the war torn steppes.\nAll of this changed in a flash when a Russian Ventrue launched an expedition to "acquire knowledge" about the Eastern invaders encroaching on her homeland. Sati was captured during the raid and had the dubious honor, mostly because she could speak some broken Russian thanks to her mother, of being chosen for the embrace to teach her new undead mistress about the ways of her people.\n\nSati did just that for a couple of years before being mostly forgotten by her Sire who never had plans for her beyond that point. When Sati left one night, nobody stopped her or even noticed.\nWhile she had been barely educated in vampiric matters, the young Ventrue did know that there were monsters of even more power than her own Sire all over Russia and further west. However, she remembered that her small Laktan tribe never seemed to have one such vampire in their midst and thus decided to track them down. Being in a familiar environment without any other vampires around seemed like the best course of action.\n\nAlmost to her surprise, Sati's plan worked well all things considered. She found the remnants of her tribe and, using her new powers, was easily accepted back.\nIn the years that followed, Sati started enjoying life (or unlife) for the first time as she used her influence to bolster her tribe, keep her safe from others and try to curb its worst tendencies.\n\nWhen the Anda Horde, following the Mongols, sent emissaries to the smaller tribes (including hers) to ask for subservience or death, Sati found herself talking to other undead lords for the first time in years. She made the only rational choice and bent the knee to the powerful invaders, sparring her people from utter destruction.\nShe now waits in her small corner of the steppes, hoping that she and her people will survive the ongoing storm."

Having married twice, she had five children who often quarreled amongst each other. Not wanting her sons to destroy themselves or perishing alone, she invited them to a dinner, and bade them to each break an arrow. When they did so, she then gave them a bundle of 5 arrows corded together, and had them attempt to do the same. When they failed, she emphasized the importance of unity. The sons internalized it, and would go on to become the ancestors of the Mongol People, as the Secret History of the Mongols would tell it. But another listener had taken her lesson to heart.\n\nYesira of the Anda approached Alan, and asked her if she would apply her wisdom to protecting her sons and their lineages in the night, while they protected her in the day. Seeing no higher honor as a mother, Alan had accepted, and joined the Anda. And in it, she found herself a cause to which she could devote herself to in mind, body, and spirit. Her every action, every course, and every directive would go to the sake of her sons' families, and in time, would accept her place as Dobrul's personal enforcer, a ghost in the steppe even among those that hide in darkness.\nShe feared nothing, relished the night sky, and sought ever greater heights for the people that came from her. She would form the Black Wind Vanguard, an order of Anda Warriors who would be the scourge of all demons that preyed on the Mongols.\n\nFuture Fate: Alan would be successful in her battles, but she could not win the war. When the Wan Kuei later storm Dobrul's resting place, her own placement deep within Wan Kuei territory made it impossible to save her grandsire.\nRather than accept death, she would flee with her Black Wind Vanguard into Siberia, where they disappeared, never to be seen again, unless whispered in fearful rumors to be at Dobrul's side once more as the Sixth Age comes."

But rather than flee from it, Dilay faced it head on. One such assassin that came for her queen was greeted with a tree branch being ran from his chest, and Dilay taking his blood for power. A priestess by day and killer by night, she did all she could to try and expunge the assassins from her people's nation, but she was one and they were many.\nFalling from favor in court from their influence, she was sent into exile in the steppes. In her struggle and will to endure, to never bow to such indignities, she found the attention of Alan, who embraced her as Dilay succumbed to exposure.\n\nWhen Alan offered the means to enact revenge evermore on similarly bloodthirsty monsters, Dilay took the chance to make sure that all those who took their fill of heartsblood choked on it.

As a Siberakh Kinfolk and coming from the depths of Siberia, Virtyana is far more used to it than many among the lineage of Caine.\n\nVirtyana grew up largely focused on surviving and providing. The Siberakh's way of life is brutal, purposely living in the most inhospitable depths of the crown of the world, while also giving nearly everything you collect to the tribe's precious few Werewolves.\nFor the most part, Virtyana made the best of it she could. But everyone has limits. And one night when a drunk Siberakh tried to find a mate in Virtyana and refused to listen to her telling him to stop, much to both their shock, the rage the kinfolk had in that moment was enough to get lucky with a foreign trinket, a silver fork being stabbed through the soft of his jaw into his head, killing him then and there.\nKnowing only death awaited her now, Virtyana quickly fled, doing everything she could to hide her scent and escape. But even for those born there, Siberia can break anyone, and on the threshold of the steppes, she lay dying from exhaustion, starvation, and exposure.\nHer story would have ended there, had the Anda Dilay not been studying her. And when Dilay showed her a world where she could be strong enough to live beyond her tribe, she embraced the Cainite nature put upon her.\n\nWithin the Black Winds, Virtyana has shaped herself as a killer of the Ferocious People. An extremely dangerous position for anyone, her experience as a Siberakh Kinfolk opens her up to more truths about their condition than rumor, making her uniquely suited to the role. And coming to delight in it, she would relish being the Black Wolf, the Bane of the Siberakh."

But while her means have changed, her purpose never has. She kills Demons. No matter the methods, the demise of the Demons of Xia is always righteous.\n\nSorkhaghtani was among the rare few Demon Hunters of the Xiongnu, born to one of their vassal cultures and trained by a master from the Han. Illuminated to the darkness in the world, Sorkhaghtani chose to fight it with fire. But the teachings upset her, to be alone and not unite others in the cause.\nSo even if she was a zealous demon killer, the methods of her contemporaries upset her. So, she broke teachings, and began to train her clan in the Demon-Slaying Arts. This offended her master, who then massacred the gathering. Leaving Sorkhaghtani for last, he mocked her efforts, and reiterated the importance of being alone. But in his gloating, he overlooked the figure approaching behind him, and Sorkhaghtani was saved by Alan tearing her former master in half. Alan then made a simple offer. Join her and fight Demons beyond death. The choice was obvious.\n\nSorkhaghtani is among the most zealous of the Anda Vanguard against the Wan Kuei. She hates them with every fiber of her being, from a young girl trained to kill them. A specialist in the practice, she has refined killing the Thousand Demons into an art form. And while Demon Hunters may seek her now, she is willing to let them come.\nShe has surpassed them."

Luckily for Samga, she has gotten quite good at it.\n\nRaised among a rather small clan, Samga's family lived under the tyranny of a mage with a god complex. Taking the Right of the First Night, having first choice on all young adults of the clan, having a small mass as fleet of concubines and indulging in many depravities that would make even hardened tyrants gag, Samga grew up in the shadow of constant terror and fear. Her father's head was turned inside out for overcooking a marmot, and her mom was removed of all limbs and grafted to a donkey's neck for not being enthusiastic enough while bedding the tyrant.\nAnd for most of the clan, that terror kept them in line. But not Samga. With the death of her parents, she stayed in the shadows, being a nobody, waiting for the moment she could indulge in her revenge. And finally, as he was calling down lightning to destroy another tribe, she saw her chance. From behind a hill, she loosed an arrow into the tyrant's eye with a metal arrow, causing the lightning bolt to strike the mage's head and blowing him up on the spot.\nAnd then, having nothing left, she simply laid down, and awaited whatever came next.\n\nWhen she awoke, she was different, and creature of the night was waiting next to her. When it promised her the chance to slay the enemies of all who threatened their people, she found it to be a noble cause, and sided with them. As a Black Wind, she would become the bane of many Mages, applying the rules of engagement against reality warpers to ensure that they could never be a threat again."

Spending most of her mortal life simply as any other member of her village, she took a great deal of time to care for the elderly. Be it bringing them water, helping prepare food, or even being someone to listen to, she was quite adept at providing them comforts when they were abandoned. So great was her love for them, that one night when one of her charges was attacked by a young tiger, without hesitation she took a saber from a guard and in a single stroke split its head open.\nSo brazen and so forthright, she caught the attention of one of the last ripples of a particular Greek's conquests, and some of the entities that hid in his shadow. One such figure would determine that this caretaker of the elderly and tiger slayer would be perfect for her lineage. And that night Shailaja was made a Lamia.\n\nShailaja did not handle the embrace near as well as her sire expected them too. Her education within the clan was difficult, especially as she largely refused to abandon her own Shakti beliefs for worship of Lilith. Her sire tried to press the issue, but one night tempers flared and fangs flied, and Shailaja was forced to flee.\nShe simply traveled where she felt was right, finally coming to a stop outside the door to the haven of the Cappadocian Fu Jiezi. Seeing glimpses of her calling in life in potentially guarding this scholar of death, she readily offered to be his bodyguard, a role he readily accepted. And as the world around them grows more tempestuous, the Bane of Khotans will not be found without his Tigerbane."

In fact, he is pretty much the opposite. As a boastful Mongol rider, his adequate fighting skills intrigued his prospective Sire that hoped that immortality would allow said skills to be molded into more. Alas, it was not to be.\nSince becoming a vampire, Belgutei did very little to impress his elders but just enough to not be punished for his laziness. The day his unlife took a turn for the worst was then he fled the battlefield during a difficult encounter with the Wan Kuei. Such cowardice should have been punished by a quick execution but Belgutei got lucky as there was need of an "ambassador" for the latest tributary of the Anda, the Laktan tribe. Seen as an unimportant and thankless post, Belgutei was sent to serve there until further notice.\nHe soon fell back into his worst habits and, as he is the representative of a much stronger power, sees himself as the rightful ruler of the tribe. Sati, the actual vampiric ruler of this community, can hardly do much against him as she would risk draw the ire of the Anda. She has resolved to hope that Belgutei's cowardice will ensure that he never actually try to act against her."    
 POD_persistentpodlore.desc.793300: "This character was created by PoD Developers to add greater depth to the setting and is not an official part of the [world_of_darkness|E].\n\nLike most of his tribe, Begluk grew up thinking that Sati was one of a kind, the immortal protector and guide of their community. His good head with numbers won him her favor and he was content to work for her (and his tribe) benefit. Things changed when Belgutei came.\nThis arrogant Mongol soon proved to everyone that Sati was just an immortal among many others and a pretty weak one at that since she seems unwilling to risk a confrontation with Belgutei's masters. The Mongol soon noticed Begluk and Embraced him, apparently mostly to flaunt his "authority" over Sati. Begluk was terrified during his first nights as a vampire, especially as his Sire had no intention of educating and helping him understand his new condition. Thankfully, Sati gave him the summary of what to do and what not to do, mostly to protect him from the tribe (and vice versa).\nBegluk is slowly recovering from this traumatic experience and, while he hates Belgutei with a passion for what he did, he also resents Sati for not having defended them better against the Mongol. His resentment might push him to make a critical mistake in the future."

That is the domain of dogs. And Ilker resents nothing more than being made into one of the Anda's Dogs. \nBorn among the golden age of the Kimek Khanate, Ilker was a hunter in his mortal life. And he was excellent at it. Particularly, he made good money hunting wolves and bears, seeking beasts and maneaters that many hunters would shy away from such threats. In his boldness, he eventually sought a rather strange maneater. In this hunt, he bit off more than he could chew, and met his soon to be sire. However, impressed by how he was able to even hunt them to begin with, they chose not to waste a prospective childer. And Ilker's inner monster was brought forth, made for all the world to see.\n\nIlker despised his current form, and tried to kill his sire out of shame and humiliation. But unable to catch them once more, all they could do was impudently rage. With ghouled beasts, they carved out a domain of their own among the Kimek Khanate, clinging to the last vestiges of pride they had as a Khan of the Night.  Only for it to then be taken when he was cornered and threatened into submission by the Anda. Ilker waits for vulnerability, desperately wanting revenge, no matter the cost.\n\nFuture Fate:When the Anda's power would begin to wane, Ilker would strike looking to gain more power in the Quincunx. He joined in the purge of the Anda, eagerly presenting them to the Wan Kuei. And for his actions, they rewarded him as he deserved - being staked, locked in a coffin, and thrown overboard into the depths of the deepest oceanic trenches, where he has never been seen from since."
