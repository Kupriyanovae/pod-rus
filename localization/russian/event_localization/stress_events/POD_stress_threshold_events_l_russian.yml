 stress_threshold.3311.t: "Нервный срыв: Зверь одерживает верх"
 stress_threshold.3311.desc: "После столетий борьбы зверь, наконец, берет верх. Вы пытались следовать по Пути, цепляться за возвышенные идеи контроля над собой, отпугивания монстра внутри вас.\nИ вы провалились.\nКогда ваша приверженность своему пути ослабевает, а сила воли исчезает, ничто больше не останавливает зверя. #R У тебя никогда не получалось держать меня под конролем. ТЫ ПРИНАДЛЕЖИШЬ МНЕ!#!"
 stress_threshold.3311.desc_instinct: "После столетий борьбы со зверем, он, наконец, повергает вас. Вы пытались следовать по Пути, преследовать амбициозные идеи, чтобы контролировать монстра внутри, использовать его силу, сохраняя при этом свою индивидуальность.\nИ вы провалились.\nКогда ваша приверженность пути ослабевает, а сила воли исчезает, волна безумия захлестывает вас навсегда. #R ИСПОЛЬЗОВАТЬ меня? ОБУЗДАТЬ меня? Ничтожество, я покажу тебе свою силу.#!"
 stress_threshold.3311.a: "Мне конец."
 stress_threshold.3321.t: "Нервный срыв: Shadow Soul"
 stress_threshold.3321.desc: "Of all the soul states, shadow soul is the most feared. During shadow soul, the character's Demon seeks to establish dominance. When a character lapses into shadow soul, they wage an inner war against the P'o's urges and insinuations.\nIf the Hun loses this war, it recedes into submission, and the P'o Nature takes over for a time — possibly causing the character to commit acts their higher self would find abhorrent. Protracted failure to resist the P'o can send a character spiraling away from their Dharma to join the ranks of the chih-mei, or worse."
 stress_threshold.3321.a: "I am lost."
 stress_threshold.3322.t: "Нервный срыв: P'o Awakening"
 stress_threshold.3322.desc: "If a [GetTrait('shih').GetName( GetPlayer )] loses themselves more and more to violence, their supernatural nature can awaken their P'o soul, in a similar manner to that of a Kuei-jin, without the benefits. [GetTrait('shih').GetName( GetPlayer )] who die when they have awakened their P'o return usually as Kuei-jin."
 stress_threshold.3322.a: "I am lost."
 stress_threshold.3331.t: "Нервный срыв: The Fall from Grace"
 stress_threshold.3331.desc: "The road of Ma’at is a difficult one to walk, and not all of the Reborn can make the journey. If a mummy falls from grace, one of two possible outcomes occurs. The first possibility is that the Judges of Ma’at will consider the mummy unworthy of eternal life. They cast mummy’s soul to Amemait, and the mummy is no more. The second option and the only chance of the mummy’s continued existence is for the Amenti to renounce Osiris and Ma’at and agree to serve Apophis."
 stress_threshold.3331.a: "I accept your sentence."
 stress_threshold.3331.b: "Save me! Great Serpent!"
 stress_threshold.3341.t: "Нервный срыв: Birth of a Spectre"
 stress_threshold.3341.desc: "A mortal who dies in especially violent circumstances or a wraith whose Shadow claims her is “reborn” as a Spectre. This is more than a simple physical transformation. The individual’s personality and psychological makeup, as well as her very physical form, are dissolved and rebuilt with the stuff of Oblivion itself. The specifics vary from Spectre to Spectre — some emerge as monstrosities, their [Corpus|E] scalded, warped, and stretched into a walking nightmare, while others seem little different save for the evidence of their death seared permanently upon them — but all bear the unmistakable mark of Oblivion."
 stress_threshold.3341.a: "I am lost."
 stress_threshold.3341.b: "You can't take me!"
 stress_threshold.3341.tooltip: "This option is available because you have the [GetPerk( 'defiance_perk' ).GetName( GetPlayer )] [perk|E]"
 stress_threshold.3351.t: "Нервный срыв: Истощение"
 stress_threshold.3351.desc: "Священное Писание утверждает, что возмездие за грех - смерть, и проклятые знают, что это правда. Демоны и рабы, подвергающиеся большим мучениям, получают смертельные повреждения каждый день на рассвете. Фактическое проявление этих травм у проклятых различается, хотя часто оно связано с пороком персонажа и неизбежно приводит к драматически ужасной кончине. Гнев может тлеть в буквальном смысле как пламя, пока персонаж самопроизвольно не воспламенится. Зависть может принимать форму яда или даже кислоты с аналогичными свойствами. Обжорство часто пожирает плоть, превращая тело в иссохшую оболочку. Гордыня может принимать форму священных стигматов, чтобы насмехаться над жертвой Христа."
 stress_threshold.3351.a: "Аах...!"
 stress_threshold.3361.t: "Нервный срыв: Undoing"
 stress_threshold.3361.desc: "The force of Banality in the mortal world is so strong that, if a fae is not careful, it can separate a fae from his mortal self. As a fae is worn down by Banality, he starts to forget his connection to the Dreaming. Memories of his fae selves disappear and a fae may fall into the Undoing, a time when a fae forgets his time as a fae and instead is subsumed into his mortal seeming altogether. Should the process not be halted or at least slowed, the changeling loses touch with his fae half entirely. What is left behind is the hollow mortal half, living his life alone in the dull, Banal world."
 stress_threshold.3361.a: "Ugh...!"
 stress_threshold.3362.t: "Mental Break: Undoing"
 stress_threshold.3362.desc: "The force of Banality in the mortal world is so strong that, if a changeling is not careful, it can separate a fae from his mortal self. As a changeling is worn down by Banality, he starts to forget his connection to the Dreaming.

 stress_threshold.2361.t: "Нервный срыв: Fire Soul"
 stress_threshold.2361.desc: "Fire soul is madness, pure and simple. Kuei-jin in the fire soul state are savage monsters, consumed by rage. The ignorant Kin-jin refer to this phase as 'frenzy', and there's little difference between the two states."
 stress_threshold.2361.a: "Succumb to your rage."
 stress_threshold.2361.b: "Resist with all your Yin Chi."
 stress_threshold.2361.fight.failed: "You failed."
 stress_threshold.2371.t: "Нервный срыв: Wave Soul"
 stress_threshold.2371.desc: "Kuei-jin suffering the debilitating wave soul completely lose control to impulses of terror. This state (so named because Kuei-jin in its grip are seemingly buffeted about by waves of fear) is considered exceedingly shameful by the Hungry Dead, who seek to avoid it at all costs, particularly in front of their peers."
 stress_threshold.2371.a: "Succumb to your fear."

 stress_threshold.1742.t: "Нервный срыв: Takeover by The Bandit"
 stress_threshold.1742.desc: "While a Kuei-jin may have a specific role to fulfill or a particular reason to have returned from the dead, the bandit is having none of it.\nThis P’o sees no use in the Great Cycle, which, after all, is far removed from its night-to-night existence. Rather, it ignores the mandates of Heaven and hell and seeks to drive the Kuei-jin to random acts of self-satisfied destruction. The bandit’s ultimate goal is to bring down the entire Great Cycle, perhaps out of resentment at being ordered back into the lands of the living, but in the meantime any target — and any representative of order — serves as a focus for the P’o’s rage."
 stress_threshold.1742.a: "My Wind Soul is overwhelmed."
 stress_threshold.1743.t: "Нервный срыв: Takeover by The Barbarian"
 stress_threshold.1743.desc: "The Barbarian seeks to reject the traditional ways of Kuei-jin and replace them with the chaotic, undisciplined methods of the Kin-jin. seeing the relative freedom of Western vampires, it wishes to abandon its heritage and join the Kin-jin in their decadence.\nThe barbarian mocks the Hun’s devotion to duty and respect for tradition, and it takes every opportunity to compare Cathayan and Western ways. Needless to say, in the barbarian’s analysis, Western ways always come out better."
 stress_threshold.1743.a: "My Wind Soul is overwhelmed."
 stress_threshold.1744.t: "Нервный срыв: Takeover by The Deceiver"
 stress_threshold.1744.desc: "The Deceiver has no use for the truth, good, bad, or indifference. It practices lying for the sake of lying — telling the Hun what it wants to hear one minute, then driving it to the brink of madness with patent falsehood the next.\nWhile this behavior may seem erratic, the P’o does have an underlying goal. It seeks nothing less than to render the Kuei-jin unable to trust himself. The more times the Deceiver gets the Hun to believe its lies — and the more times it tells the truth and is ignored — the less the Hun can trust its own judgment. If the P’o has its way, eventually the Hun’s will is wrecked, and the vampire finds himself incapable of making a move or any decision without the loving advice of the Deceiver."
 stress_threshold.1744.a: "My Wind Soul is overwhelmed."
 stress_threshold.1745.t: "Нервный срыв: Takeover by The Demon"
 stress_threshold.1745.desc: "The Demon seeks to devour all. Anything weaker than the Kuei-jin is prey, and anything stronger is power that can be subsumed through treachery. While the Demon may pay lip service to duty, friendship, and honor, it’s devoted to personal power and has no concern for the opinions of others.\nTo the Demon, all that it sees exists for its amusement, for it to destroy and devour at its whim. Other souls matter only in terms of how they relate to the Demon — and how quickly the Demon can devour them."
 stress_threshold.1745.a: "My Wind Soul is overwhelmed."
 stress_threshold.1746.t: "Нервный срыв: Takeover by The Fool"
 stress_threshold.1746.desc: "A Hun afflicted with a Fool is in for a frustrating unlife, as its P’o begs for explanations of even the simplest or most self-evident action. Furthermore, the Fool is incapable of long-term or preplanned action, and sees no virtue in either. As such, it works as hard as it can (it does get distracted easily) to get the Kuei-jin to take the easy, simple way, and to avoid unnecessary risks (read: Any complications).\nA Fool P’o is never silent, and its incessant prattling can drive even the most self-controlled Hun to distraction."
 stress_threshold.1746.a: "My Wind Soul is overwhelmed."
 stress_threshold.1747.t: "Нервный срыв: Takeover by The Legalist"
 stress_threshold.1747.desc: "The Legalist P’o has no tolerance for deviation from the celestially ordained order of things. There’s no room for interpretation or improvisation in this P’o’s world; everything has a specific role to play, from which it can’t deviate.\nAny action the Kuei-jin takes that contradicts this divine order — whether speaking familiarly to one higher in rank or taking insubordination from an inferior — causes the Legalist to fly into a rage until the “insult” has been set aright. Of course, only the P’o can decide what constitutes appropriate atonement, either by the Kuei-jin or another. As such, a particularly sadistic Legalist P’o can keep its other half jumping through very formal hoops for days (or even longer)."
 stress_threshold.1747.a: "My Wind Soul is overwhelmed."
 stress_threshold.1748.t: "Нервный срыв: Takeover by The Monkey"
 stress_threshold.1748.desc: "While the Kuei-jin may have returned to the Middle Kingdom for a reason, the Monkey doesn’t much care. It’s a creature of the moment, its each new pleasure or distraction being the most important thing in the world. The Monkey is capable of concocting elaborate plans to achieve small or momentary goals, but it’s in no way concerned with any overarching mission that the Kuei-jin might have. Indeed, the Monkey seeks, at every turn, to waylay the Cathayan from her appointed goal, to divert all of the vampire’s attention and energy to lesser, transitory things."
 stress_threshold.1748.a: "My Wind Soul is overwhelmed."
 stress_threshold.1749.t: "Нервный срыв: Takeover by The Slave"
 stress_threshold.1749.desc: "The Slave has no trust for the Kuei-jin’s judgment, which it seeks to undermine at every turn. Whenever possible, the Slave does its best to place the Kuei-jin under the control of another. This course is for the best, obviously, as the Slave knows that the Kuei-jin is incapable of doing anything properly himself.\nTherefore, it questions every decision the Hun makes and seizes every opportunity to force the Kuei-jin to submit. Not surprisingly, once the P’o succeeds in enthralling the Hun, the Slave immediately starts to bemoan its fate and urges the Hun to escape, to seek another “master” to guide it through existence. Ultimately, the Slave seeks to serve the Yama Kings, and Cathayans with a strong Slave Archetype often become akuma."
