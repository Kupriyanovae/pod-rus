 POD_patron_council_join_seeker_decision_desc: "The core faction is referred to as the Seekers. They are the heart of the Patrons, those fae who hold closest to the old legends of the 'shared rulership' system of council. With a liberal view of each Origin, and a membership drawn almost equally from all three, these fae truly believe in the ideological ramifications that shared rule might bring. The Seekers are comprised mainly of scholarly, hidebound fae, and as such have a relatively low-key presence in the public eye. This is the faction of the Patron Council that delves deeply into the tomes of old legends and sends out searchers on the trail of even the vaguest rumor of historical faerie lore. Lost artifacts, fragile manuscripts that speak of the past age, even weapons and items of ancient craft-these are all clues to the ways of the past, and are invaluable to the Seekers' cause."

The Vanguard occupies a unique role in the Patron Council, in that its members are the public face of the organization. Rather than a formal and united group, the Vanguard is generally just those fae who vocally and visibly extort the Patrons' virtues and support its cause. Most of the politicians, diplomats, advisors and other social stars of the Patron Council are grouped under the term Vanguard, used without affection by everyone outside of this "faction within a faction." Needless to say, the members of this faction are a diverse breed with as many differing ideologies and agendas as there are fae themselves. Rather than a cohesive collection of fae who agree on the true past of the race, an overwhelming majority of the Vanguard are simply in the game of politics for one thing and one thing alone."

Unlike the Seekers, who are hidden by virtue of the delicacy of their task, the Austere Conclave is shielded from the public eye because its members actively desire it that way.\nFor the Patrons as a whole, the Austere Conclave is dangerous, unpredictable, unreliable, destabilizing... and extremely useful. It is the source of many of the ugly rumors regarding the Patrons — tales of assassinations, ambushes, intercepted couriers, leaked communications between allied courts — all of this and more. When a fae whispers to her friends that the Patrons killed Lady Davina for what-ever reason, she is usually unknowingly referring to the unsanctioned actions of the Austere Conclave."
