 pod1230objectives_wraith.1.t: "Transcendence"
 pod1230objectives_wraith.1.desc: "Transcendence is fundamentally about accepting one's death. Historically, the Ferrymen, Far Shores, and Hierarchy were all intended as mechanisms for achieving Transcendence. Charon's mandate from the Lady of Fate was to help the souls who ended up in the Underworld achieve Transcendence and move onwards.\nTranscendence is fundamentally about accepting one's death. The things that keep a wraith bound to the underworld, Passions and Fetters, must be Resolved. Once everything is resolved, the wraith must seek some form of harmony with his Shadow."

 pod1230objectives_wraith.2.desc: "Risen is a term used to describe a wraith that has managed to return to its body to walk among the living in the Skinlands. For want of a better term, Risen are almost zombies, however without the slow gait, decaying flesh, or need to eat brains. To become a Risen is one of the closest guarded secrets in the Shadowlands; however, with help, it can be done.\nFor any wraith wanting to come back to the lands of living, this is likely the most sensible possibility, though not without its drawbacks and challenges."
