 podgrandcity.02.desc: "Thanks to your efforts, much of the temple has been rebuilt.

 podgrandcity.03.t: "Teachings of the Court of Dust and Bones"
 podgrandcity.03.desc: "This temple is aptly named, for what else remains but dust and bones when exposed to power blood magic? The many tomes here speak of Set, his achievements, and his powers. A trove of knowledge lies before you, you need only take it."

 podgrandcity.04.desc: "Here lies Sobek, blessed child of Set. It is said that Set turned the Mokolé into an abomination using powerful blood rituals. Being both a methuselah and an abomination means that Sobek is one of the most powerful creatures alive. Now he slumbers here, the aspect of Hunger itself. There is strength, chaos, and carnage found in this hunger. By worshipping the Crocodile God, perhaps this strength can be obtained."

 podgrandcity.05.option.a: "This is the way."
 podgrandcity.05.option.b: "Interesting, but my path remains the same."
