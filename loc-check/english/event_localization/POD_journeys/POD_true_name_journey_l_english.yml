 POD_learn_true_name.1.t: "True Name"
 POD_learn_true_name.1.desc: "The True Name of a being is both its existence, its history and its identity. A human could think of it as a platonic blueprint of the being. It is a word that encompasses every part of its target, from its internal organs to its very soul.\n\nThe more intelligent a being is, the more complex its True Name is. Animals have comparatively simple Names, while the Name of a human can change through life-changing experiences.\n\nFinding True Names is a harrowing task in itself and demands a deep psychological understanding of the target. If a person knows its own True Name, it can safeguard it against magi who would use it against him by inscribing it via arcane runes and magical wards."
