 pod1230objectives_kj.1.t: "Flash of Dharmic Insight"
 pod1230objectives_kj.1.desc: "By virtue of what they are, [kuei_jin|E] see themselves as fundamentally unclean. Still, they serve some purpose under Heaven. A Dharma helps guide her to that purpose, it helps reflects her rise above her original state. Wisdom — and the hunger for it — often comes with age, for the first few years of her uhlife, the [kuei_jin|E] finds herself enmeshed in mortal concerns. Resplendent in her newfound powers, she usually returns to her old home to settle a few scores and carve a new piece of turf. After a while, however, she understands that mortal games are like a thousand scattered grains of rice — too small to collect and too tedious to pursue. A [kuei_jin|E] who survives long enough to appreciate immortality eventually wants more than mere superhuman powers. The quest down a Dharmic road takes a [kuei_jin|E] many mortal lifetimes; the lanterns of that quest — moments of insight called den — goad her onward in the night.\nDen are flash of insight, in which things suddenly become clear. Such flashes indicate progress in a Dharmic journey. The one truly destined to find enlightenment knows how to recognize and act upon these precious (but fleeting) moments."
 pod1230objectives_kj.1.a: "It is time."
 pod1230objectives_kj.1.b: "This isn't the right moment."

 pod1230objectives_kj.2.t: "The Hundred Clouds"
 pod1230objectives_kj.2.desc: "The higher reaches of Dharma are as invisible as the water droplets in a mountain cloud. As indescribable as the scent of night. A [kuei_jin|E] must exist for many mortal lifetimes before the sublime truths of The Hundred Clouds become obvious. Until then, he may recite the sutras, speak the koans and command the elements, without truly understanding what it is he does.\n"The Hundred Clouds" is a metaphorical term for ultimate peace, the transcendent state in which even the duties of Heaven are set aside. The Clouds are not power, although lesser [kuei_jin|E] might see them that way; they are not illusions, though they might seem so to individuals who cannot understand them. By joining The Hundred Clouds (which the wise understand to be a symbol, not a group), a [kuei_jin|E] reaches the hreshold of godhood, but waits to guide others to that door.\nLike the mists that form them, The Hundred Clouds are intangible. No sutra can contain their essence, and no lesson can impart their truths. It has been said that a [kuei_jin|E] who achieves such a state is no longer a vampire — or that he has become the ultimate vampire. Perhaps he is both. The gods aren't talking.\nAnd the slopes of Mount Meru are very steep."
 pod1230objectives_kj.2.a: "It is time to rejoin perfection."

 pod1230objectives_kj.3.t: "A Step Back"
 pod1230objectives_kj.3.desc: "Sometimes, a [kuei_jin|E] — especially a young one — acts so selfishly that insight dims. The Demon feeds on such mistakes and encourages them whenever possible. By acting like a petty mortal, the [kuei_jin|E] can actually cost herself enlightenment. If she cannot rise above trivial concerns, the sages reason, a [kuei_jin|E] deserves to stew in them for all eternity!\nNobody's perfect however. Even the greatest ancestors have their weak moments and may lose sight of their roles under Heaven. The only true defeat happens when the stumbling [kuei_jin|E] fails to consider that the journey is long and that she has immortality in front of her to try again."
 pod1230objectives_kj.3.a: "Learn and grow from this failure."
